# UT.6.01x Embedded Systems - Shape the World   

This will be a repository for all the lab assignments I've done as part of the UT.6.01x MOOC.  
I started with coding experience but no electrical engineering knowledge.

## Description
Each folder will contain all the necessary files for the specified lab.  
I will indicate what I edited in the `README.md` of each folder.  
Some labs also require the building of a physical electrical circuit which I will try to include in a `CircuitDiagram.jpg`.  

## Common Files
There are some file types which will appear in every lab assignment.  
I will just describe their purpose here instead of repeating in each `README.md`.  


`***.uvproj` `***.uvgui` `***.uvopt` - uVision files (open `***.uvproj` to get everthing)  
`***.axf` `TExaS.h` `texas.o` - autograder files   
`tm4c123gh6pm.h` - useful address definitions for launchpad  
`startup.s` - startup file  

## Requirements
[__Kiel uVsion 4__](https://www.keil.com/demo/eval/armv4.htm) - All the coding were done on this IDE.  
[__Stellaris/Tiva LaunchPad__](https://www.keil.com/demo/eval/armv4.htm) - Everything is meant to work on this launchpad _(I used a EK-TM4C123G)_.  
[__Electronic Components__](http://edx-org-utaustinx.s3.amazonaws.com/UT601x/worldwide.html) - The physical circuit requires a few misc electrical components.  

## Other Resources
[__e-Book__](http://users.ece.u   texas.edu/~valvano/Volume1/E-Book/) - essentially a transcript of the edX lessons.  
[__Course Website__](http://edx-org-utaustinx.s3.amazonaws.com/UT601x/index.html) - To help edX students get started on the MOOC.
